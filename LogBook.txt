I cleaned all of the functions. For the linSplitFun, i left a back up of the code you wrote. Erase if you are ok with my code. I checked, it gives the correct entropy/infoGain.

What is the difference between axisSplitFunc and linSplitFun ?

I didnt understand part of your code (why axisSF and linSF / how the data are sorted etc).
So I kept your code (after correction) and commented it at the bottom, and wrote the function the way I saw it. 
Lets discuss your functions soon so that we can merge our codes :)

Question on your code :
In linSplitFunc, i don't understand how you sort the data in the beginning... Need more info on how you were trying to separate the space
lineNodeSplit : line 116, why use m and n when we could use the exact location [i,j] ?
