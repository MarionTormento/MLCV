Hello my king,
I modified a bit all of the functions. The new process is now 

[children, infoGain] = optimalNodeSplit(param, rootNode)
	axisNodeSplit
		for x=[-1 1]
			childrenAndInfo
				compute the outputnodes
				computeInfo : compute the info gain
		return best info gain and best children for axis 'x=...'
	linearNodeSplit
		for m=[]
			for p =[]
				childrenAndInfo
					samesame
		return best info gain and best children for linear
	best Infogain => children and infoGain
	
The functions briefly describe in the code.
Not sure my way is the best way to go... especially the last part of the optimalNodeSplit is not pretty !

Cheers
