02/03/2018 Erection rising quality code
My dearest,
You'll find our cleaned and reviewed version of the code.
I've cleaned through the coursework1.m and testTree.m
I've cleaned and rewrote trainTree.m in Copytraintree.m. 
Normally i didnt alter you traintree.m so try mine, compare and if you like it suppress your, rename mine and live on.
When you see the plot it looks less pretty so maybe there is a mistake ... lmk

In addition i've created an accuracy function that returns the accuracy of the tree compared to the train data so that
we can see thanks to the graph and thanks to numbers how well we perform

Much Love
