Hello my king,

1) Few things to finish on the testscript 
- correct the minX maxX etc for linear, something doesnt make sense when you look at the linear curve we get
- force the linearSplit when deltaX too small and we risk blocking the thing
- why the tree{2..4}(4,:) has more than 8 columns? Something is not clearing correctly somewhere

2) Copy everything in coursework and clean the % not needed anymore

3) better the visual with a mention of which tree, which levels etc

4) celebrate
